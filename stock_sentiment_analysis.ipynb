    "# Indian Stock Market Sentiment Analysis from Reddit\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook makes it very easy for you to create sentiment analysis data from r/indianstocks subreddit about specific Indian stock tickers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features:\n",
    "- **Stock-Specific Analysis**: Analyzes Hinglish comments for specific Indian stocks (RELIANCE, TCS, HDFC, etc.)\n",
    "- **Dual Sentiment Analysis**: Uses both TextBlob and VADER for comprehensive sentiment scoring\n",
    "- **Real Stock Data**: Pulls live stock market data via Yahoo Finance\n",
    "- **Configurable Parameters**: Easy to change target stock, time period, and analysis depth\n",
    "- **CSV Export**: Automatically produces two CSV files for further analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Parameters to Customize:\n",
    "- **selectedTickerSymbol**: The NSE stock ticker you want to explore (e.g., 'RELIANCE.NS')\n",
    "- **howmanysubmissions**: Number of submissions to analyze (takes ~5 seconds each)\n",
    "- **time_period**: Analysis period ('week', 'month', 'year')\n",
    "- **min_ticker_mentions**: Minimum mentions required to include a post\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Files:\n",
    "1. `comment_analysis.csv` - Sentiment analysis results\n",
    "2. `stockticker_history.csv` - Historical stock price data\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect for analyzing retail investor sentiment on Indian stocks! 📈"
