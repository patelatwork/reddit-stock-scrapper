Survived a Credit Card fraud today. Sharing my experience for an educational purpose.,p7cc6r,2021-08-19,1101,"I am glad to hear that you did not become a victim of fraud. It is good that you were aware and became suspicious that the call was a fraud. But everyone is not that lucky. Many people have fallen prey to the tactics of these fraudsters and have lost their precious money. So never share your OTP with anyone. Even if someone from your bank calls you and asks for your OTP, be wary. You never know that it is a genuine person or fraudster, as we have seen in this post. Even banks and NBFCs like HDFC, SBI, PNB, **Bajaj Finance**, and others keep reminding their customers not to share their OTP.

I have two primarily - the Amazon ICICI (Like a lot of people here), I think it has genuine benefits - 5% cashback is real. That is like a 5% discount on almost all the stuff we buy. The other one is an HDFC Infinia, all family expenses are routed through that one, giving us plenty of points. I deliberately try and spend everything through that card to push up the billing amount, because of the points. Pre-Covid all our holiday flight tickets would come from those points. During Diwali we also give the kids spending money either at Croma or Shoppers stop via vouchers through these points. I never ever roll over the debt, pay it in full and a few days in advance. I even use Cred to make the payments and get a few rupees from Cred too :-) not to mention I was able to donate a zillion Cred points for oxygen last month.

How to see if a bank is risky for placing your deposits? [A guide from a banker],jwesme,2020-11-18,693,"Most Banks are still very far enough from any moratorium type position. It is unlikely that any big SFB or Bank will fail. So if you have money either in Bandhan, Ujjivan, AU or anybank which has to report numbers every quarterly it is unlikely that will fail, LVB was in trouble for a very long time, it has been no surprise that it was acquired by DBS. I also own a bank account which is in a smaller type of Bank(RBL) but for safety I have an alternate account in Kotak Mahindra. As long as you don't have a major amount of money in a corporate bank whose numbers you cannot find and the amount is north worth of 5 lakhs, I wouldn't worry about anything. In terms of safety, these banks are too big to fail as per RBI are SBI, HDFC and ICICI. A very important point to note is there has been no loss of depositors money in any of the bank failures and even in the unlikely event of a very big bank bank failing, it is unlikely the RBI or/and government will let it fail.

My thorough research on Base cover + Super top-up health insurance policies,mxekfy,2021-04-24,667,"Amazing analysis. I was trying to do something similar this morning and thought let me check reddit, someone might have already done it. However, this would be even better if you include all the 1Cr plans everyone is selling. Those offer same/similar benefits at much lesser premiums. I myself own a HDFC Ergo optimum restore (about to expire) and was surprised at how similar it's to their Koti Rakshak policy but offers 6 times less amount (15 lakh). Since I was on the lookout for a policy myself, I did a lot of research as well. Finally bought the Manipal Cigna Lifetime Health. The premium is 25k for 1Cr benefit. I compared it to HDFC, Star, Care and Max Bupa. Unfortunately all of them either had some restrictions on room rent or the post hospitalization cover duration was low. Moreover there was one another criteria that's really important to me: Air Ambulance. I travel quite a lot, at times remote locations and never know when I'll need air lifting. All these things are only available in Cigna. The premiums except Star were similar as well. Star was charging close to 40k, so that was a straight no go. Tough call between HDFC and Manipal but HDFC had a limitation on room type (single private). Also some of the modern practices aren't covered. Network isn't a problem as Cigna has half a dozen hospitals within 2km radius of where I stay. They offer a great accidental cover separately of around 1k for 50 lakh benefit which I am thinking I'll buy later. One thing I'll point at is that opposed to what OP has mentioned, the premium for Cigna isn't over over the top cheaper compared to others. Very similar I would say and marginally better benefits.",gyc2sr4,[deleted],3,2021-05-16,HDFCBANK.NS,4,0,True,4,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1

When you invest in selective blue chip companies, you don’t need to track all the news every day or week. Your way is applicable more to small cap stocks than blue chips. Even a small negative news about blue chip stocks catch everyone’s attention and become a big news which you’ll come to know easily during your daily news headline reading. Also, many big companies are now much bigger and they find a way to tackle any big issues immediately. (E.g. HDFC bank, ICICI Bank, Infosys etc).

But there is an optional upgrade for HDFC which will waive most of the limitations like this 75K limit, room rent capping, and will add sum insured restore and enhances No claim bonus accumulation to 50% for non-claim year instead of 10%. I don't know the extra premium for this feature though, yet to talk to a rep. In comparison, Max Reassure (base, 10L) has unlimited restoration( for any member, any illness), so it is effectively 10L coverage for each member even on a family floater, then the STU can cover any cost >10L for each claim. Not an advice per se, just wanted to add/highlight some points, and an alternative to this.

Rs 900 per month gets you a 1 Crore Health Insurance policy which is at the same cost as 10 Lakh policies and seemingly with no negatives!! There is a new breed of Insurance policies out there which we need to talk about.,on9y1o,2021-07-19,471,"Take a look at a few hard to spot red flags that you may find missing Unless you are very conversant 1. Exclusion for diseases that have a genetic basis 2. Capping or denial of robotic surgeries or laparoscopic procedures 3. Cancer drug related caps or denial eg monoclonal antibody body treatments where s single injection can be upward of 1 lakh 4. Other expensive therapies like transplants 5. Age limit , does the policy cover till age 80/90 or does it run out at 60/65 The real danger of these policies is that you buy them at a young age and when you hit 45 plus and get admitted , you discover the fine print For example a recent motor vehicle claim was denied by HDFC ERGO , because the policy was sold for a Royal Enfield motor cycle and the policy had a cap of engines less than 150 cc . Risk is like dog poop on a poorly lit road , you only realise it is there when you step into it Remember one thing , for a common man an insurance is something to rely on For an insurance company it’s a giant game of probability",hkql8rq,Geriatric-Vibe,2,2021-11-15,HDFCBANK.NS,1,0,True,3,Negative,Neutral,bearish,-1,0

US investing options for Indians - Personal experience,lpefwk,2021-02-22,463,"I think I can share my experience with Vested. I opened my account on January 2020. Back, then there was no fees to open account. * For Deposits - Initially there was no online transfer available. So, you need to fill some forms which can be downloaded and they will arrange you a pick up from bank to collect the form. You don't need to go to bank to submit the form. Bank will charge FX transaction fess which came around RS.2000 for me when I deposited $800 USD. Now, I believe online transaction is available if you have account with HDFC and ICICI. * For Withdrawals - Vested charges $11 + FX transaction fees from bank * For tax - To avoid getting taxed from both US and India there is some double tax avoidance agreement between US and India. Dividends which you get will get taxed in US and Capital gain(Long term/short term) will be taxed in India. For dividends, tax amount will be automatically detected from your account and only remaining amount will be deposited to your Vested account. Everything is clearly mentioned in transaction history. Then, from your vested account you can either withdraw it to your bank or keep re-investing in stocks. * For tax documents - They provide following documents pre-filled for each financial year. General Filings Summary, Foreign asset filing summary, Form 67 filling summary. * Support - So far had good customer support during account opening and for deposit.

Common personal finance mistakes,jv90nv,2020-11-16,422,"The most under estimated factor in investments is Psychology and Behaviour. Reams have been written about it , just a few common examples : 1. Investment in insurance. I agree is a big no no. However, certain people can only save if they are FORCED to save and there are consequences for pre closure or missing a payment. In no way am I endorsing Insurance (other than term). But it’s a fact that lots of people need to have fill it shut it and not be able to remove it sort of investments. 2. If I buy an iPhone for 1 lakh on EMI and invest the 1 lakh I have saved for better returns, then I am clever. But most people won’t be able to figure out a place to invest. Or will be too lazy to do it. 3. Being so busy in daily life, people tend not to be proactive in reviewing their investments. For example, I still have 10,000 invested in HDFC TOP 100 which even today is giving negative returns. And I am already invested in some of the best funds in the country. 4. Lots of people tend to break liquid investments at the first sign of an emergency. Such people need to invest in illiquid assets.

"PSA: don't procrastinate, buy term insurance before 30/11/21",qvsu68,2021-11-17,414,"I have been researching a lot about what term insurance to get for the past couple of weeks. Here are some pointers (backed by an excel sheet calculation) which might help you to make a decision. Writing from a perspective of 26/Male/NonSmoker/. Annual Income: 22LPA (PostGraduate) Policy Term: 40 Years (Till the age of 66) I have a STAR Health Insurance policy of Sum assured 5L which will in addition pay 5L on death/Permanent Disability. And a LIC Jeevan Anand which will pay 10L whenever I die. (Regret it though) Companies (should be) considered (in no particular order): HDFC Life, Tata AIA, ICICI Prudential and MAX Life. Go for a reputable brand. Once you're gone your beneficiaries will have to deal with getting the claim. Better the company, easier for them in the moment of grief. E.g. ICICI Prudential @ 26 years of age. 3 Cr - No riders - 40 Years - Regular Pay - Annual Premium \~25k. **Remember:** 1) Insurance is not an investment. 2) Account for inflation (5-6%) while choosing a policy cover. 1 Cr looks great as of now bur 15 years later it won't be sufficient. Choose a higher cover with affordable premiums. 3) Increasing Cover option is a good choice. Limited companies provide it. The cover increases by a fixed % every year till it is 2x the starting base cover. Premiums are fixed lifelong. MAX and Bajaj Allianz offer increasing cover options. (Policy Bazaar) 4) Don't confuse #3 with life-stage benefits in which you opt to increase the cover at marriage/kids and premiums also increase. TATA and ICICI offer Life Stage Benefits. (Policy Bazaar) 5) MaxLife is showing a 5% discounted figure for the annual premium on Policy Bazaar. Your yearly premiums from the 2nd year will be not discounted, so a bit higher. (Refer to the strike-through figure on MaxLife official website for the actual amount) 6) Use dummy data to explore the insurance aggregators and official sites to avoid spamming. (I made an official account 2 weeks later and got 4 property calls in 2 days) 7) You will come across 4 combinations of Term Life: a. Regular Pay means pay for the entire policy term. b. Regular Pay with Return of Premium means paying for the entire policy term and getting all the paid premiums back after the policy term ends, provided you're still alive. c. Limited Pay (5, 10, 12, 15 years) means to pay for a lesser/limited no. of years. The entire premium to be paid is reduced by 50%. (Some policies limit their rider benefits if you choose Limited Paym like ICICI) d. Limited Pay with Return of Premium. (NEVER consider) I'd suggest you outrightly reject everything except a. Considering purely from an economics and Time Value of Money PoV. The Return of Premium (RoP) makes no sense as the amount you'll get after the policy term will be not as valuable as compared to what it is today. The yearly premiums will shoot up by \~1.8x if opted for RoP mode. E.g. You pay 25k for 40 years i.e. 10L in total With RoP, you pay 45k for 40 years i.e. 18L in total. You pay 8L extra to get 18L back. Let's think about investing. If you invest 20k extra per year (1600 monthly SIP) in an index mutual find considering 10% RoR for the next 30 years. You'll make 35L. Double!! Consider LTCG taxes @ 10%, you're still good. The RoR is very conservative. You can fetch 12-15% too! So, you PAY LESS and INVEST the overhead. The Limited Pay option also makes lesser sense from the same PoV. This mode will shoot up your yearly premiums by more than 2x. Effectively, you would be paying less than 40-50% in total. But consider the yearly premium you pay today and the same yearly premium you pay 20/30 years later. The latter will be far easier, far smaller and far less valuable as compared to today. Firstly, the company wants you to pay as early as possible because the more amount they get now, the more they are able to invest. They understand money will lose value as time progresses and it'll be difficult for them to generate returns later on. Secondly, the company doesn't have to keep worrying to get the premiums for the next couple of decades. If you pay earlier and something happens to you in the 15th year of the policy term, it will be a win-win for them because they already have all the premiums. E.g. In regular pay, you pay 25k for 40 years i.e. 10L in total. With Limited Pay, you pay 55k for 10 years i.e. 5.4L in total. Looks good? Wait. 5.4L in next 10 years v/s 10L in next 40 years. So, you pay 30k extra for 10 years i.e. 3L more to reduce your premiums by 4.6L. in the next 10 years! Let's think about investing again! If you invest 30k extra per year (2500 monthly SIP) in an index mutual find considering 10% RoR for the next 10 years. You'll make 5.5L. Keep it going for the next 10-20 years. You make 56L! Consider LTCG taxes @ 10%, you're still better. 8) One more point that companies make is that the longer the policy term more the chances that you may face difficulties paying the premium (you might be short of funds later). But by basic disciplined investing as seen above you can generate enough amount to pay off your premiums for regular policy terms in a very easy way. They also say that in the long run, you might forget to pay off the premium. Even if you miss a premium paying year, the policy is as good as dead. Solution? Switch on Auto-Debit. 9) A limited pay exception might be the case where you can afford to pay and just want to be done with paying off the premiums to clear up liabilities. 10) After payment (online mode) there is a proposal form that needs to be completed for further processing. 11) Opting for the policy from an aggregator say Policy Bazaar looks good. They do help your kin during the claim process. IDK how efficient will they be? Another option is through the official website. And next option is third-party agents. 12) Always opt for YEARLY payment mode. 13) Different insurers cover different no. of critical illnesses in their Critical Illness rider. Tata(40), HDFC(19), Max(64/22 - Very expensive) 15) The Waiver of Premium rider's premium amount fluctuates when you change the life cover amount, paying term and RoP mode. The Critical Illness rider's amount remains the same with changing life cover amount. 16) Combining 2 different policies to achieve max. features and riders will ALWAYS cost more. It boils down to personal choice though. I hope that was helpful. Researched a lot so thought of sharing my 2 cents.

It has happened with me that I didn't pay attention and in a hurry forgot to select NEFT and paid using IMPS. And I had to pay IMPS charges. I wrote to the senior management asking why is it selecting IMPS by default. Let it be NEFT. Now that NEFT is 24x7 money gets cleared in half an hour. Those who want even immediate transfer can choose IMPS manually. I blamed the management that you are earning from the ignorance of user. In response they told me that it's a technical decision by the tech team. I was laughing at their answer. Tech team doesn't take any decision on their own. Until management tells them what to do. But I left it there because the discussion was not leading anywhere. 2. With HDFC I had a Savings account and a LAS (Loan Against Securities Overdraft Current Account). At times it has happened that the balance in my savings account was lesser than the overdraft a/c. For example per say, let say my savings account has balance Rs 10,000 and my overdraft account has balance Rs 1 lakh. Now when I was trying to make a netbanking transaction for electricity bill payment of Rs 500, by default it selects the account with higher balance. So it has happened with me that in a hurry, I paid through my LAS overdraft account and only later I realised it when it starts incurring interest on that amount. I wrote to the senior management again, saying I have enough balance in my savings account (Rs 10,000) > Rs 500 (electricity bill) then why are you selecting overdraft account by default. Had it been the case that I am trying to do a bill payment of Rs 15,000 which is higher than the balance of my savings account, then you can probably select LAS account. But again my feedback went into deaf ears. I understood that HDFC is just to make money off you by hook or crook. That's why I don't keep my money with HDFC anymore. I keep in IDFC. But to avoid monthly average balance charges, I have set HDFC as salary account which makes it zero balance account.

I m saying this because a lot of ex hdfc ppl from their tech teams have joined my bank, and all they know how to do is mail-follow up on project time lines. HDFC has a very good Finance & Risk team, that's why their fund management/loan book is in a better condition compared to others.",gehpr1h,fullmetalpower,1,2020-12-03,HDFCBANK.NS,2,2,True,2,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1
