Why I gave up on active stock picking and sold every individual stock I own,piar0i,2021-09-05,618,"Why not both? By all means, keep the bulk of your investments in mutual funds but if you have it on good authority that a company will do well (say HCL/TCS etc. From ten years ago) then I don't see the problem with buying a few stocks for the long haul",hbo95uv,Keepingshtum,47,2021-09-05,TCS.NS,2,0,True,5,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1
USD INR Relationship (for people interesting in understanding the concept rather than falling in propaganda),1gp00ze,2024-11-12,435,"India exists so that sons of piyush goyal can party abraod using your dollars, so that gadkari can pay dowry in dollars to his son in law and fly them via parivate jets, so that all the ias officers, babus, and sdm, send their kids abroad from class 8 onwards using YOUR DOLLARS which you fetch via export, body shopp, work. I really do not understand why people over complicate the issue. The more and more people going abraod for education will make sure the more and more are banned from touching dollars, be it overseas mutual funds being banned which invest in s&p500 index, pure form, be it currency ban, be it 20% tcs. All this exist so that you keep giving up your dollars to the babu.",lwq97q9,[deleted],11,2024-11-12,TCS.NS,2,0,True,3,Negative,Positive,neutral,-1,1
"Averaging down, buying more of an asset biggest wealth destroyer: Zerodha CEO",ni7scv,2021-05-22,382,It all depends on which company you have invested. Nothing is absolute in the stock market. If its companies like HDFC/TCS/Reliance etc which are very strong companies and market leaders in their segments then I can think of averaging down to some extent but I do kind of agree with him. He's speaking from experience and data he collected through his company. Averaging down is probably what causes the losses to go up exponentially most of the time. If it goes down in consolidation zone and if we are averaging down then our capital might be stuck there while other opportunities slip out of our hands.,gz0s41f,Famateur,23,2021-05-22,TCS.NS,2,0,True,5,Positive,Positive,bullish,1,1
"Averaging down, buying more of an asset biggest wealth destroyer: Zerodha CEO",ni7scv,2021-05-22,382,"Another common problem with retail investors is fear of buying ""high valuation"" stocks. If you are picking market leading franchises then don't let valuations put you off. The premium you pay is well worth it because these stocks recover first after any crash. The calibre of stocks I'm talking about is HDFC Bank, Bajaj Finance, Pidilite, Asian Paints, Kotak Bank, Nestle, TCS, etc. Concentrate majority of your portfolio in such companies and you'll see great returns - with minimum downside in the worst of times.",gz2jjt2,facelessredditer,1,2021-05-22,TCS.NS,2,0,True,7,Negative,Neutral,bearish,-1,0
